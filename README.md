MinecraftCL aims to bring OpenCL support to my game, totalcrafter/minecraft3, and the original minecraft. Currently seeing about a 60% decrease in generation time in my game. 
Working on aqctual Minecraft Support. Note: tested on my 1060 and 3800x. You will get much better improvements with newer cards.
