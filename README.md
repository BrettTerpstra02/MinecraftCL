MinecraftCL aims to bring OpenCL support to my game, totalcrafter/minecraft3, and the original minecraft. Currently seeing about a 60% decrease in generation time in my game. <br>
## TotalCrafter

!Working on actual Minecraft Support. Note: tested on my 1060 and 3800x. You will get much better improvements with newer cards.!<br>
# Normal Minecraft
The plan is to support Minecraft. Coming soon.
